## Challenge: sound and music
Can you add sound effects and music to your game? For example, you could have your game:

+ Play a sound when the player gives a correct or incorrect answer
+ Play a ticking sound as the countdown timer runs
+ Play a sound when the player's time is up

Your game could also constantly play background music on a loop.
