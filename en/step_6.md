## Challenge: create a start screen

Can you add another backdrop that is going to be the start screen for your game?

You can use the `when I receive start`{:class="blockevents"} and `when I receive end`{:class="blockevents"} blocks to switch between the backdrops.

To show or hide the character when your game switches between backdrops, you can use `show`{:class="blocklooks"} and `hide`{:class="blocklooks"} blocks.

To show or hide the timer and score when your game switches between backdrops, you can use `show variable`{:class="blockdata"} and `hide variable`{:class="blockdata"} blocks.
