```blocks
- when flag clicked

+ when I receive [start v]
set [number 1 v] to (pick random (2) to (12))
set [number 2 v] to (pick random (2) to (12))
ask (join (number 1)(join [ x ] (number 2))) and wait
if <(answer) = ((number 1)*(number 2))> then
	say [yes! :)] for (2) secs
else
	say [nope :(] for (2) secs
end
```
